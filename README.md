📚 Optional: Future Ideas
 Competitive mode with timer

 Leaderboard for fastest correct submissions

 Compiler themes (VS Code light/dark, Dracula, etc.)

 Custom Docker setup instead of Judge0 for more control

🗓️ Timeline Estimate (if you work regularly):
Phase	Duration
Setup & Phase 1	3–5 days
Phase 2–3	5–7 days
Phase 4	3–5 days
Phase 5–7	5–10 days
Final touches	2–3 days



💡 What You Should Do Next:
1. 🔐 Add User Authentication (Login / Signup)
Let users:

Create an account

Log in and save their code sessions

(Optional) Use Firebase Auth or JWT with MongoDB

If you're interested:
"Yes, I want auth" → I’ll give you the full starter.

2. 🧠 Save Code History (For Logged-In Users)
Let users save code with title, tags, language

Show them in a "My Snippets" dashboard

Add “Load”, “Edit”, “Delete” options

3. 🖨️ Add a “Public Codes Gallery”
Like CodePen:

Users can mark their snippets as “Public”

Others can view, search, and run those snippets

4. 🎯 Add Leaderboard / Gamification
Track most active coders

Award badges like “Python Wizard 🐍”, “C++ Slayer ⚔️”

Use Firestore or MongoDB to store data

5. 📦 Deploy to Production
Make it public!

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify

Backend: Render / Cyclic / Railway

Add a custom domain like justcoding.dev

6. 📚 Bonus: Markdown Editor or Interview Mode
Add an “Interview Mode”:

One person shares a coding room with another

Live collab coding

Timer, question panel
