# 🧠 JustCode — Where Code Meets Clarity

Ever been stuck in a coding bug spiral or felt too shy to ask for help?

**JustCode** was born out of that moment — where you’re staring at your code, frustrated, and wishing there was someone (or something) to *just explain* what’s going wrong. So, I built this.

## 🚀 What is JustCode?

JustCode is a powerful, all-in-one online code editor made for developers, students, and curious minds. It’s more than just a code runner — it’s your debugging buddy, your AI-powered teacher, and your live collaboration hub.

Built with ❤️ using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and integrated with GPT, JustCode is designed to help you:

- Understand *why* a piece of code works (or doesn’t).
- Debug code with GPT’s insights.
- Share sessions and collaborate in real-time (DevZone 💬).
- Store your inputs, outputs, and even export your session as a clean PDF.
- Stay in your flow, with themes, language support, and intuitive UI.

## ✨ Why I Made This

I’ve been through those moments — the ones where you know the syntax but not the **logic**, or where you feel stuck even after hours of searching Stack Overflow.

JustCode is my attempt to bridge that gap.  
To make code feel less isolating and more collaborative, supportive, and fun.
